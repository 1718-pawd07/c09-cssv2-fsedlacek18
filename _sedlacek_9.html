			<p>The global presentation of cheerleading was led by the 1997 broadcast of ESPN's International 
			cheerleading competition, and the worldwide release of the 2000 film Bring It On. Cheerleading organizations 
			such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying
			universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids, and tumbling 
			passes from being included in the cheerleading routines.  In order to prevent injuries, there are strict
			rules that squads must follow, depending on their level(1-5). The NCA 
			dealt with this situation by forming a separate division calling it the All-Star Division (which I was in before joining Padua's varsity team) 
			and debuting during the 1987 season. As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of gyms were founded, with squads attending competitions
			sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of guidelines.</p>

			<p>The USASF began in 2003 to control cheer. However the dangers of are well known, the NCAA does not 
			recognize cheerleading as a collegiate sport; there are no documented numbers on college cheerleading, yet when 
			it comes to injuries, two thirds of female athlete injuries at the college level are due to cheerleading mistakes.
		    Another study found that in a span of 25 years, there were 103 serious/fatal injuries recorded
			among female high school athletes, with the vast majority occurring in cheerleading. I love cheer, yet I have 
			suffered many major injuries, including torn ligaments, a broken collarbone, a sprained neck and multiple concussions.</p>
